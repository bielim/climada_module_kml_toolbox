# climada_module_kml_toolbox
toolbox to write kml/kmz files for GoogleEarth
=========================

KML Toolbox v2.7 downloaded from http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34694-kml-toolbox-v2-7 (see license below) and made specific changes to the functions contourf.m and point.m.



climada_module_kml_toolbox
=========================
this repository contains an additional climada module, please install climada (the core module) first, see repository named simply climada.

in order to grant core climada access to additional modules, create a folder "modules" in the core climada folder and copy/move any additional modules into climada/modules, without 'climada_module_' in the filename. 

E.g. if the addition module is named climada_module_MODULE_NAME, we should have
.../climada the core climada, with sub-folders as
.../climada/code
.../climada/data
.../climada/docs
and then
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME with contents such as 
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME/code
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME/data
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME/docs
this way, climada sources all modules' code upon startup

see climada/docs/climada_manual.pdf to get started
